Rancher Kubernetes Engine (RKE) is a CNCF-certified Kubernetes distribution that runs entirely within Docker containers. It solves the common frustration of installation complexity with Kubernetes by removing most host dependencies and presenting a stable path for deployment, upgrades, and rollbacks.

> StackGres is not actively tested with RKE, if you find any problem, please [open an issue](https://gitlab.com/ongresinc/stackgres/-/issues/new).

There is no particular configuration that should be applied to RKE in order to run StackGres.
