[DigitalOcean Kubernetes](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/kubernetes/) (DOKS) is a managed Kubernetes service that lets you deploy Kubernetes clusters without the complexities of handling the control plane and containerized infrastructure.

> StackGres is not actively tested with DOKS, if you find any problem, please [open an issue](https://gitlab.com/ongresinc/stackgres/-/issues/new).

There is no particular configuration that should be applied to DOKS in order to run StackGres.
