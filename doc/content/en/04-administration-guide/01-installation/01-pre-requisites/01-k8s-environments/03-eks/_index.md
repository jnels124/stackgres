[AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/) (EKS) is a managed Kubernetes service that eliminates the need to operate and maintain the availability and scalability of Kubernetes clusters in Amazon Web Services (AWS).

> StackGres is actively tested with EKS (see the [tested versions page]({{% relref "01-introduction/07-tested-environments" %}})), if you find any problem, please [open an issue](https://gitlab.com/ongresinc/stackgres/-/issues/new).

There is no particular configuration that should be applied to EKS in order to run StackGres.
