[Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Container Engine for Kubernetes](https://docs.logz.io/docs/shipping/containers/oracle-cloud-infrastructure-container-engine-for-kubernetes/) (OKE) is a fully-managed, scalable, and highly available service that you can use to deploy your containerized applications to the cloud.

> StackGres is not actively tested with OKE, if you find any problem, please [open an issue](https://gitlab.com/ongresinc/stackgres/-/issues/new).

There is no particular configuration that should be applied to OKE in order to run StackGres.
