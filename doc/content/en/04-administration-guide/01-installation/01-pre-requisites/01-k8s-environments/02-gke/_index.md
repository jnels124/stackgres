[Google Kubernetes Engine](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/) (GKE) is a Google-managed implementation of the Kubernetes open source container orchestration platform.

> StackGres is actively tested with GKE (see the [tested versions page]({{% relref "01-introduction/07-tested-environments" %}})), if you find any problem, please [open an issue](https://gitlab.com/ongresinc/stackgres/-/issues/new).

There is no particular configuration that should be applied to GKE in order to run StackGres.
