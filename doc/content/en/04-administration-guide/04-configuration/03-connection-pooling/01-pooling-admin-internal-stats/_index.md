## Accessing the Pooling Admin console

PgBouncer includes an admin database-style connection for getting valuable information about the pool stats, like 
counters, aggregations, client and server connection, etc. Those values are critical to be understood for a production
alike environment.

Access the console through container socket and `pgbouncer` user (this user is only available when connecting directly to pgbouncer through socket):

```
kubectl exec -it  -c postgres-util test-0 -- psql  -p 6432 -d pgbouncer pgbouncer
psql (12.4 OnGres Inc., server 1.13.0/bouncer)
Type "help" for help.

pgbouncer=# \x
Expanded display is on.
```
